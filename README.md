# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

During this course I worked on developing an intelligent agent that could navigate a maze. The premise of the game was for the intelligent agent (pirate) to move about the maze and find the best path to reach the goal (treasure). Using neural networks and Deep Q-Learning algorithms, the intelligent agent ran through many states to learn the maze and find the best path available to reach the goal. Code that was provided was the .py files and a large amount of the .ipynb code. It was my job to create the code in the .ipynb file that would allow for the agent to have reinforced learning from each state that was created when the agent ran the maze. 

**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientits create programs out of the image that they have themself or what the client is asking for when it comes to creating an application. They write code that easy to understand with comments for users or other computer scientits can follow easily. Put in place functions that allow for the data that is required to be run more efficiently, and set up the base of what the program is set up to execute.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

When it comes to issues or errors in the code, I review the code first to see if there are any errors with the syntax (proper commas, colons, and proper indentations of lines). After I would start to debug the functions and find what is not working through that method. Commenting out code that may be the issue and putting in more efficient code would allow for me to get a better understanding of what an issue that is occurring is due to.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

My ethical resposibilities to the end user and the organziation are to make sure that software being created has as little bias as possible so that everyone is happy with the implementation of how the software functions. That personal information is not being put in a position that others may take it and use it illegally and in a harmful manner to the individual it belongs to.
